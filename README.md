# Counting-people-video
Counting the number of people in a video. 

Using the Tensorflow Object detection API, we will be counting the number of people in a video. A frame is extracted every 30 seconds from the video and a forward pass of the model is performed. If a person is found in the video, then the count is increased. 

## Requirements
OpenCV - 3.3.1
Tensorflow object detection API
